<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Basketry is one of the oldest and most valuable of the crafts. As far back
as the time of the Israelites we read of its usefulness in offering
sacrifices. Of necessity it was born, and in its infancy was made into
simple forms, but very soon its importance to man was so duly felt and
appreciated that new forms took shape, and its uses were so extended that
the early basket makers vied with one another in producing pleasing work
and in discovering new and various kinds of materials to put into it.</p>

<p>Though the Chinese and Japanese have sent us, for long years, marvelous
things of beauty, it is to our American Indian that we owe our debt for
beauty and artistry of this industry; for industry it is.</p>

<p>It seems quite impossible to me to write on basketry without mentioning
the Indian and his connection with it, for we can very safely call him the
master artist of basket work. In its history, and a romantic one it is,
the Indian figures
first<!--013.png--><span class="pagenum">xii</span>
and last. The Indian woman was never satisfied
with the materials just at hand; she sought for and tried all kinds, in
season and out of season, and she chose, unerringly, the best. Her
patience was without limit in her experiments in materials, dyes and
weaves, with the result that her basketry is the peer of any in the world.
Her sample work was nature&mdash;and into every line of her basket she wove a
meaning symbolical of something in particular.</p>

<p>Serious study of Indian basketry would serve both as an inspiration and
stimulation to better work: its intricacy, its poetry and its artistry
would be a revelation, and give a fuller understanding of a people so
sadly misunderstood.</p>

<p>Basketry was used by the primitive Indians in carrying water. When there
was a scarcity, and careful conservation was necessary, the basket was the
article used as a conveyance. Some of the California Indians up to this
day use their baskets successfully as cooking utensils, while the
bassinet, made out of basketry, was, and is still, used by the Indian to
hold the papoose.</p>

<p>Basketry is an important factor in the promotion of education. Its wide
influence is felt not only in the class room but in homes, settlement
work, blind institutions, asylums, in fact in institutions of
all<!--014.png--><span class="pagenum">xiii</span>
kinds.
The importance and influence of basketry is being recognized now and the
work is being carried on in earnest. Within the past five years it has
made a great jump and in most institutions where manual training has been
introduced, basket making has attained a prominent place in the training
of the child.</p>

<p>Basket work is a valuable aid in the character building of the child, for,
through it can be given lessons in patience, perseverance and
concentration, while truth and honesty can be effectually impressed on the
worker, resulting in the gradual though steady developing of the will
power.</p>

<p>Our reorganized school systems show what a specific educational value
manual training has, not alone in the manual skill which the child
attains, but also in the mental, moral and economic values which it gains.</p>

<p>The desire to construct and create is strong in childhood, and here in
basketry will be found an astonishing aid in inspiring such desire and in
developing constructive ability. Children, especially boys, find it
fascinating and it is a work which appeals to them in all their moods;
frequently when they are unable to do any other kind of school work they
turn with delight to basketry.</p><!--015.png--><p><span class="pagenum">xiv</span></p>

<p>The child who works steadily over a basket, and may have it to weave and
reweave many times before completing it satisfactorily, is not only
receiving a valuable lesson in patience and thoroughness, and gaining much
experience which will be of inestimable value later on in this particular
work, but he is being trained into an efficient workman of the future.</p>

<p>Basket making, which handwork the children love best to do, not only
develops their judgment, makes keen their observation, makes them
discriminating, but it has a stimulating effect upon their minds and
awakens in them the desire to put forth their best efforts. Hanging
baskets, scrap baskets, trays, etc., mean something more to them than a
piece of basket work done merely because of its utility. Instinctively
they recognize the true intrinsic value of the work and that they are real
workers, but also it is the beauty and the surprises in basketry
development that has its strong and attractive appeal for them.</p>

<p>Owing to the simplicity of basketry the work is being generally accepted.
The child of seven or eight years may make a simple mat and basket and
find it play work, while the older child may make beautiful useful baskets
and trays for the home.</p><!--016.png--><p><span class="pagenum">xv</span></p>

<p>Originality in the child has full play and should always be encouraged
since the field of work in this ground is abundant; and he should never be
discouraged, no matter how loose the weaving may be nor how crude it may
look: he will soon be able, through comparison, to discover his mistakes
and correct the poor work.</p>

<p>I would suggest that children be permitted to criticise their own and each
other’s work.</p>

<p>The celebrating of the holiday seasons can be nicely carried out in the
manual training period when the making of birthday gifts, Christmas trays,
Easter baskets, sewing baskets, hanging baskets and scrap baskets can be
appropriately introduced. Try this suggestion, and watch the happiness of
the child who makes gifts for his loved ones.</p>

<p>Sequence in basketry should be followed carefully with beginners, and
although it will be impossible to give in detail all the steps included in
the subject, the most essential and important will be given, with many
suggestions in models for advanced workers.</p>

<p>In conclusion, just a word to the special class teacher of backward,
defective, and the backward or defective delinquents. The course presented
in<!--017.png--><span class="pagenum">xvi</span>
this book may be used in the sequence given or adapted just as is
necessary to the class of children taught. Most of the models here
demonstrated have been successfully taught to children in the backward
delinquent class and have been a means of promoting, mentally and morally,
the welfare of the child; directing his miscontrolled energy into proper
channels, besides making his school life a brighter and happier one.</p>

<p>That this book may be of help to the basket maker and that it may bring
much success and happiness to the reader is the wish of the author who has
spent many happy hours in preparing it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<br />
EQUIPMENT</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Materials</span></p>

<p>The materials used in making these baskets are rattan or reed, raffia,
rush, straw, hemp.</p>

<p>Rattan is a palm which grows wild in India, Japan, China and East India
Islands. The rattan seed is black and corresponds in size to a pea. It is
a notable fact that, while growing, the rattan always faces the sun. The
shoot of this seed grows four years; it is then cut close. The plant
produces almost three hundred shoots which are cut annually. These slender
shoots attain a length of from three to five hundred feet. They climb the
highest trees and hang from them in graceful festoons. It is interesting
to see how, like the selfish pumpkin vine, they crowd out any other plant
that should happen to be in the way. By small fibres which spring from the
joints,
they<!--021.png--><span class="pagenum">20</span>
fasten themselves to the trees, and they hold so tenaciously
and have such grip or strength that it requires several men, sometimes as
many as a half dozen, to separate and remove them.</p>

<p>The reed is manufactured from the rattan. It has been manufactured in
America for about sixty years. There are a number of such manufacturing
plants, among which the Wakefield Rattan Company and the New England
Company have made splendid reed. Germany and Belgium give us the best
reed, while the least desirable quality comes from China.</p>

<p>The outer surface of the rattan is glazed. It is cut in long narrow
strips, and is familiar to everyone under the name “cane.” It is used in
caning chairs. From the pith or inside rattan, we get the reed known as
oval, flat and round, the latter being most extensively used.</p>

<p>The round reed varies in sizes from No. 00 to No. 17; No. 00 being the
finest, is used in making the centers of baskets, in finishing handles,
and in making very small baskets and trays. Sizes 1 to 5 are used in
making ordinary size baskets and trays, 5 and 6 for scrap baskets, 8 and
10 for handle foundations.</p>

<p>The reed comes only in the natural color,
but<!--022.png--><span class="pagenum">21</span>
may be dyed into many
beautiful colors either before or after the article is made.</p>

<p>Oval or split reed comes in sizes 5 and 7. This reed makes artistic
hanging baskets.</p>

<p>The flat <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch wide is often used in making foundations for sweet grass
baskets, and it also makes durable scrap baskets.</p>

<p>Raffia is the outside covering of the Madagascar palm. It is a light,
tough material imported in the natural or straw color, but may be dyed in
many beautiful colors. It is sold in bundles or braids of from one to four
pounds. Care should be exercised in using this material. It is advisable
to keep it in canvas bags or hang it in braids in the class room, as
careless handling may cause untidiness or tend to disorder in the class
room.</p>

<p>Rush, flat or braided, is imported and sold in the natural and dull green
colors. The flat rush is sold by the pound, the braided by bundles or
bunches. The braided rush makes a strong scrap basket; it must be soaked
before using to prevent cracking. The flat rush is used in making smaller
baskets.</p>

<p>Straw is used as a weaver, and can be woven either wet or dry, but it is
better to dip it in water a few minutes before using. Round and oval
scrap<!--023.png--><span class="pagenum">22</span>
baskets may be made by combining different colors of the straw with the
natural color.</p>

<p>Hemp, which is imported from the Philippine Islands, may be used as a
foundation for raffia and sweet grass baskets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tools</span></p>

<p>Very few tools are necessary in basketry, although, to the basket maker,
who intends doing much work the following articles are essential: pruning
shears, awl, plier, galvanized tub and bucket, measuring stick or rule,
knife for splicing the reed. Rubber fingers may be used. For the dyer,
rubber gloves and large earthen pots are necessary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<br />
THE FIRST LESSON</h2>

<p>Reed is a brittle material, therefore it must be soaked in water before
using. The time required depends on the number of the reed used. No. 00
merely dipped in water can be used successfully. Nos. 1 and 2 can be used
after soaking in water ten minutes; Nos. 4 and 5 after fifteen or twenty
minutes. Either cold or hot water may be used, the hot water consuming
less time to soak the reed than the cold.</p>

<p>No. 4 and No. 2 reeds are commonly used together in ordinary sized
baskets. No. 4 for the spokes, which form the foundation upon and around
which No. 2, as the weaver, is woven.</p>

<p>The weaving of a round mat or basket is begun in the center and woven out
toward the end. It is absolutely necessary that beginners master the
fundamental steps, for no basket can be well made that has a poor bottom.
In order to avoid this, the mat is practised upon until the art of weaving
a good center is accomplished.</p>

<p>The following are the commonest weaves used.</p><!--027.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simple Weaving</span> is the commonest of all and is the continuation of under

second and third weavers are treated in the same way, always bringing each
weaver in front of 2 spokes and back of the next one. This weave is used
mostly in beginning the sides of separate bottom baskets where the spokes
are inserted, and in the ending of baskets. It is a strong foundation for
borders and handles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sixteen-Spoke Center</span> means sixteen spokes arranged in groups of fours
in the following manner: first, four spokes are placed in a vertical
position, the next four in a horizontal position over the first four, the
remaining eight spokes arranged in diagonal positions, one diagonal four
laid over the other diagonal four in an opposite direction. A weaver is
placed under the left-hand horizontal group and simple weaving is woven
over one group and under another until four rows are completed. The spokes
are then separated into groups of twos by bringing the weavers over and
under every two spokes instead of four. This may be
finished<!--033.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
either in

<p>Make an incision in the center of each of 4 spokes as illustrated in Fig.
1. Through these 4 spokes insert the other group of 4 spokes and the short
spoke as in Fig. 1. You are now ready for the first step. Place a wet
strand of raffia back of the 4 horizontal spokes; pass it over the group
of 4 vertical spokes, back of the 5 horizontal spokes, over the lower 4
vertical spokes and back of the first group of horizontal spokes. Separate
the groups of fours into groups of twos by bringing the raffia over 2
spokes, under 2 spokes, treating the short spoke as a separate group. Fig.

<p>With No. 2 light blue reed, weave one row, stopping at the spoke to the
left of where the weaver was inserted; back of this spoke, insert a
natural color weaver and weave one row around meeting the first weaver.
Continue the weaving now
with<!--066.png--><span class="pagenum">57</span>
the blue weaver, work in this way, first
with blue reed, then with natural color, until eight rows are woven&mdash;you
now have a striped effect of four rows in blue and four in white. In order
to get the checker effect, the weave must now change. Bring each weaver
back of two spokes at the end of the eighth row of weaving. If the weaving
is correct the ninth row of weaving, which is in blue, will be woven under
and over the same spokes as the eighth row, which is white. The ninth row
is the beginning of the new group of weaving. Continue this weaving until
you make five or six checks. The weaving should now be four rows of blue,
four of white, four blue, four white, four blue, which gives a prominence
to the blue, and makes a decidedly artistic piece of work.</p>

<p>During the weaving the spokes should be held in an outward direction.
Follow this with two rows of triple twist and border described as follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plaited Border</span></p>

<p>This border is especially appropriate for large baskets and trays. Allow
thirteen inches for this border, spokes <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch apart.</p>

<p>Insert 4 spokes which should be one inch longer than the spokes of the
basket. Place
each<!--067.png--><span class="pagenum">58</span>
spoke by the side of each of 4 border spokes. This
makes four groups of 2 spokes each. Number these groups 1, 2, 3, 4. Bend
down towards the outside of basket No. 1, 2, 3 groups. Take No. 1 group
pass it over Nos. 2 and 3 groups, in front of No. 4 group, and back of the
next spoke which is No. 5 spoke. Bend down No. 4 group towards the outside
of basket. Place No. 2 group over No. 3 and 4 groups, and back of No. 6
spoke. Bring No. 1 group, which is back of No. 5 spoke, to the outside of
basket, by crossing it over No. 2 group between No. 5 and No. 6 spokes.
Now bend down No. 5 spoke by the side of this group. Pass No. 3 group over
the two groups on the outside of basket, and up between the two upright
spokes. No. 2 group is brought to the outside of basket by crossing it
over No. 3 group between No. 6 and No. 7 spokes. Bend down No. 6 spoke by
the side of this group. No. 4 group is woven in same manner as No. 2 and
3. After the fourth group is woven, you should have one group of 2 spokes
on the inside of basket and three groups of 3 spokes each on the outside
of basket. Continue the border by weaving two of each group of 3 spokes,
lying on outside of basket, over the next two groups on the outside of
basket, in front of the first upright spoke, and back of the second where
it rests until next
group<!--068.png--><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
is woven. The first inside group now is drawn
to the outside of the basket by crossing it over this group between the
two upright spokes. The first upright spokes are always bent down to the
outside of basket by the side of this group. When all the groups are woven
in this manner, there should be 1 spoke from each group facing the outside
of basket, and four groups of 2 spokes each on the inside of basket where
the border is completed. Cut all the spokes closely.</p>

<p>The first three groups of spokes at the beginning of the border should not
be drawn tight, enough space should be left to allow the last three groups
of the border to pass through them easily. The remainder of border should
be woven tightly and close to the basket.</p>

<p>Over the 16 spokes weave a base in pairing four inches in diameter. In the
first three rows, consider each group of fours as one spoke, then separate
the group of fours into groups of twos with seven rows of pairing.
Consider each group of 2 spokes as 1 spoke throughout the base. The base
should now be four inches in diameter. Turn the spokes with an upset of
three rows of triple twist No. 2 brown reed.</p>

<p>Holding the spokes slightly up and outward, weave the basket two inches
high. Now drawing the weaver tightly and pushing spokes inward toward
center of basket weave twelve rows of single weaving. Finish with three
rows of triple twist No. 2 brown reed. When this is completed take each
spoke, and bring it out back of the next spoke to the right and down
through the three rows of triple twist. Holding the spoke firmly, pass it
through the three rows of triple twist at the base of the basket. Continue
this with each group of spokes, which will show the striped effect on
outside of basket. When all the spokes have been pulled through the triple
twist at bottom of base, turn the basket upside down, and if the open
border at the top of the basket is even, you are ready to

color. Weave these two colors in pairing. With the spokes slightly flared
outward, weave the sides, in the striped effect, 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches. With two
weavers of blue and one of natural, weave two rows of “Wale.” Finish with
Open Border No. 2.</p><!--077.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Handle</span></p>

<p>Insert one end of the 20 inch spoke of No. 4 reed down through the
weaving, to the right of one of the spokes of the basket. Insert the other
end on the opposite side of basket in the same way. Place the end of a
blue weaver down, through the weaving, by the side of inserted spoke,
twist it over the handle, then under, then over, next under, over, until
the end of the handle is reached, thus making nine twists around the
handle. The last twist is passed back of the handle, over the triple twist
to the inside of the basket, then it is brought to the outside of basket
under the triple twist. Following the twists around the handle, the weaver
is twirled in this way until the handle is completely covered by the blue
weaver. Four rows of this weaving around the basket will cover the entire
handle. To fasten the end of the weaver, carry it back of the spoke,
between the woven handle, and down through the triple twist, where it is
made secure and then cut off.</p>

<p>On a three inch base, weave a slightly rounded basket five inches high.
Finish with Closed Border No. 2.</p>

<p>In making a lid for a basket the first thing to be decided on is its
shape; if the basket is barrel shaped, the lid to harmonize should have
the curved effect. The lid of this basket is rounded to correspond with
the basket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lid</span></p>

<p>Weave a good center, over the 6<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> spokes, with either raffia or No. 00
reed. After <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch is woven, begin with fine No. 2 reed, and weave two
rows, drawing the spokes in with the weaver. After two rows are woven,
hold the spokes slightly outward and weave fourteen rows. Complete the
basket<!--084.png--><span class="pagenum">71</span>
with the following border which is suitable for lids of baskets:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rope Twist Border</span></p>

<p>Each spoke is passed in front of the next spoke to the right and brought
inside the lid. For the second row, each spoke is passed to the outside of
the lid over the next spoke to the right, and to the inside of the lid
where it is cut off carefully.</p>

<p>The ring handle is made in the following way:</p>

<p>With a strand of No. 2 reed, 17 inches long, make a ring about one inch;
then weaving alternately with one end and then the other, pass the ends in
and out around the ring&mdash;two rows complete the ring. When the ring is
finished you should have ends about 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches long. These ends are
fastened above two rows of the weaving in the lid, thus securing the ring
to the lid.</p>

<p>After the lid is placed in proper position on the basket, it is fastened
by holding the ring down by side of the basket and placing the center of a
strand of No. 2 reed back of a spoke in the basket. Draw both ends out,
and in the form of a cross, pass them over the lower part of ring, draw
them under the weaving to the inside of the basket where they are woven in
and out to make them secure.</p><!--085.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>The rings for the front of basket and lid are made in a similar way, the
ends being woven in and out amid the weaving of the basket and lid. One
ring should be smaller than the other to keep the larger ring from
slipping out.</p>

should be slightly drawn in. The following border is used: first row each
spoke is run back of one spoke and out to the front; second row, each
spoke is passed in front of the next two spokes and in back of the third
where it is cut off. Diameter of top of base should be almost five and a

woven and separated with No. 00 reed. Weave twelve rows of No. 2 reed
next. Then with oval reed No. 5, weave in single weaving, five rows. Hold
the spokes, to get a slightly rounded effect. Turn down the spokes with
four rows of triple twist. Finish the basket with the Rope Twist Border,
described under Model 20. The diameter of the lid should be a little over
6 inches. It should fit the basket so as to slide off and on easily. The

HANGING BASKETS</h2>

<p>If it is possible to add more beauty to nature in the arranging of flowers
and vines, etc., the use of the various and wonderfully attractive hanging
baskets that can easily be made will afford the opportunity. The
harmonious selection of flowers to combine harmoniously with the color of
the basket is open to the artist and craftsman. The opportunity is wide
for originality in the making of these baskets. The basket maker finds
himself flooded with so many ideas that it is impossible to put them in
book form. The following are a few suggestions.</p>

slightly inward and drawing the weaver tight, work twenty-six rows.
Complete the basket with three rows of triple twist and the following

front; second row, each spoke is brought in front of two spokes and in
back of the next spoke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Handle</span></p>

<p>Place an end of the No. 5-27 inch spoke through the triple twist at bottom
of basket, bring it up through the triple twist at top of basket; do the
same on the opposite side of the basket. When the handle is thus arranged,
with two rows of No. 2 reed make a twisted handle. Arrange the twists
about an inch and a half apart.</p>

<p>After fastening the center with two rows of weaving, weave three rows,
separating the spokes in twos; then weave fourteen rows in pairing. Insert
the 96 spokes, placing three spokes by the side of each spoke of No. 4
reed. After all the spokes are inserted, weave three rows of triple twist,
No. 2 reed; considering each group of three spokes as one spoke, weave
five rows in double weaving. With No. 2 reed, weave three rows of triple,
separating the spokes in groups of twos. Complete with the following
border. Consider each group of twos as one spoke. Take one group and place
it over the next two groups, under the next two, over the next two, under
the next two, over the next two, under the next two and out in front. Do
the same with each group of spokes. Allow the first groups to be woven
loosely until all the groups are woven; then draw the loose groups tight.
Make the border uniform throughout. You are now ready for the border on
the base of the tray. Two rows are woven to make the stand for the tray.
First row, each spoke is brought in front of next three spokes and back of
next three. Second row, each spoke is brought in front of the next three
spokes where they are cut off inside the weaving.</p><!--148.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>Insert the two pieces No. 6 reed between the border and triple twist.
Leave about a two inch space between the inserted spokes. Fasten securely
with No. 00 reed. With No. 2 weavers, weave three rows in twirl effect
around one spoke, until about 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches are woven up on the spokes,
then considering both spokes of handle as one, continue the weaving until
you are opposite to where the spokes are joined. Now coil the weaver
around one spoke to the end of the handle, bringing the weaver each time
down under the tray and up on the other side of spoke. Treat the other
spoke in the same manner until both spokes are uniform. Hold the weaver
tightly throughout the weaving of the handle. A loosely twisted coil makes
a very poor handle.</p>

<p>If the handle is woven correctly, groups of three coils around the handle,
with a space of about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch apart, will be the result.</p>

<p>Bore 60 holes through the board large enough for No. 2 reed to slip
through easily. The holes should be one-half inch apart&mdash;19 holes on each
of the lengthwise sides and 12 on each end.</p>

<p>Pass the spokes through each hole. Allow 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches for the bottom of
tray. For the base border weave one row of pairing and the following
border: Each spoke is passed in front of the first spoke
to<!--160.png--><span class="pagenum">127</span>
right and
back of the second spoke. When all the spokes are woven in this way, place
the tray on a flat surface and make sure the base border is perfectly even
and level.</p>

<p>The cretonne and glass should be identical in size. Lay the cretonne on
the board flat and even, and place the glass over it. The glass must fit
snugly and tightly to make a perfect tray. Keep the spokes moist to allow
easy weaving. The weavers must be soaked until very pliable. Weave <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inch of pairing with No. 2 reed or nine rows. Follow this with one row of
triple twist in No. 3 reed. The plaited border completes the tray.</p>

<p>A very pretty effect may be obtained by having a pale pink flowered
cretonne and natural color reed. The cretonne and color of reed should
always harmonize.</p>

Insert the spokes and allow 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches for the bottom stand. Make a
border for this stand in the following manner:</p>

<p>First row, each spoke is brought back of next spoke to right.</p>

<p>Second row, each spoke is passed in front of the next spoke and in back of
the next where the end is cut off.</p>

<p>The sides are now woven. A 4-rod coil No. 4 reed holds the glass firmly in
place. Follow this with seven rows double weaving No. 2 brown reed and one
row No. 4 reed in 4-rod coil. Complete the tray with the plaited border.</p>

<p>After the tray is finished, singe it to get rid of all the loose bits of
reed&mdash;then polish the board with two or three coats of wax. The cretonne,

<p>The holes should be made about one inch apart. Insert the 52 spokes and
make foundation stand as described under preceding model. Be careful that
the board is perfectly dry before placing the cretonne upon it. Keep the
spokes moist by using a wet sponge; be careful not to allow any water to
get under the glass while weaving. Best results are obtained by staining
the board first and then weaving a dyed reed; good results, however, may
be obtained by making the tray in natural reed first and then staining the
board and reed. Great care must be exercised in painting the tray after it
is made.</p>

<p>The sides of the oval tray are woven two inches high. First weave one row
of 4-rod coil then seven rows of double weaving in pairing. One row of

in front of next spoke to right and in back of second spoke where it is
cut off.</p>

<p>This base weaving should be uniform throughout so that the tray base may

<p>Take two pieces of the 15 inch spokes and weave as 1 spoke, one row in
simple weaving. Now insert a strand of No. 2 reed and make eleven rows
simple weaving, working the first row under and over the same spokes as
the two 15 inch spokes are woven.</p>

<p>Weave one 15 inch spoke, weaving from right to left, under the first spoke
and over the second. Introduce a No. 2 weaver, and work eleven
rows,<!--193.png--><span class="pagenum">150</span>
beginning under the first spoke and over the second. Weave another No. 4
spoke. Continue in this way, first one No. 4 spoke, and then ten or eleven
rows of No. 2 reed, until the thirteen pieces of No. 4 reed are woven.
Both ends of the tray should have two No. 4 spokes woven as one. The
weaving should now measure 9 inches by 6 inches.</p>

<p>Weave one row of triple twist around the tray. Wet and turn both end and
side spokes sharply upward. Make an upset of three rows of triple.</p>

<p>With the spokes moist, weave the following border:</p>

<p>First row, each spoke is brought back of the next spoke to the right and
out to the front.</p>

<p>Second row, each spoke is passed in front of next three spokes to the
right and back of the fourth where it is cut off.</p>

inserted between the spokes Nos. 11 to 17 (eleven to seventeen) inclusive,
and between the spokes Nos. 27 to 33 (twenty-seven to thirty-three)
inclusive. Insert a weaver back of any spoke, which may be called No. 1
spoke, and work one row around the basket in plain weave. In the second
and third rows, between the spokes Nos. 11 to 17 (eleven to seventeen) and
Nos. 27 to 33 (twenty-seven to thirty-three) the weaver should pass back
and in front of the same spokes as in No. 1 row. That is, in the first
three rows the weaver should pass back of Nos. 11, 13, 15, 17 spokes, in
front of Nos. 12, 14, 16 spokes, back of Nos. 27, 29, 31, 33 spokes, in

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<br />
A FEW WORDS ON DYEING</h2>

<p>The art of dyeing has been of interest to the peoples of all nations and
in all ages. History shows us that just so soon as man’s covering or
clothing, the furs and skins of animals, was discarded for wool, linen or
cotton materials, just so soon was the desire or want for colors made
manifest. Man began the study of coloring, of staining and dyeing; he
experimented, and in his new need he worked to reproduce the reds, the
purples, the blues and the yellows of nature’s exquisite canvas, with what
success and failure we have a fair knowledge.</p>

<p>Nothing appeared too small or too unimportant to put in use in order to
gain the desired results. Vegetables, fruits, plants, barks of trees and
sometimes ludicrous mixtures were part of the workings for this purpose,
all of which did meet with rewards&mdash;for dyes and beautiful colors were
discovered.</p>

<p>From the plant <i>indigoferae</i> was obtained a blue stain, known as indigo.
Specimens of dyeing found in the Egyptian tombs show examples
of<!--209.png--><span class="pagenum">162</span>
indigo
dye. This plant (<i>indigoferae</i>) grows and is industriously and profitably
cultivated in South America and India. It was imported by the Romans from
India, getting its name from that country. Two other important dyestuffs
discovered in the early ages were saffron, which gives yellow shades, and
madder-root, or to be more specific, the roots of madder, which produces
brown and purple shades.</p>

<p>Thus was obtained and supplied the blue dye from vegetable or plant life;
and from animal life came the most beautiful red dyes.</p>

<p>Cochineal, lac and kermes better known as “grain colors” and called so
because of their general resemblance to grain, are really the dried bodies
of insects, minute in size, called “cocci” berries, which lived and
thrived on certain kinds of bushes and trees and which, after months of
care, were taken from their berths and dried.</p>

<p>These dyestuffs, used of course with a mordant, produce beautiful shades,
which are fast to water and light.</p>

<p>Perhaps no greater nor more remarkable changes have been made in any
industry than in that of dyeing, for, the saving of labor, energy, time
and money by the use of modern chemical agencies
is<!--210.png--><span class="pagenum">163</span>
of a magnitude not
easily appreciable. New ways have completely supplanted the old. This
revolution was due to the accidental discovery of mauveine by Sir William
Henry Perkin, who by this and his later experiments enriched the world
with one of its most important discoveries. After his discoveries became
known great factories sprang up throughout Europe manufacturing coal-tar
dyestuffs, shortly producing the “Basic dyes.” Perkin’s discovery served
as a stimulus to other chemists, who, working unceasingly, soon produced
quantities of dyestuffs, which are designated as “Aniline Colors.”</p>

<p>Though progress has been made and the discoveries have simplified greatly
the processes of dyeing, this does not mean that experimenting has ceased.
By no means. Today interested and enthusiastic workers are anxiously and
patiently experimenting, and hoping to find something new; perhaps they
will, or it may be you, who, through your experimenting, will uncover to
the world a new wonderful dyestuff.</p>

<p>In preparing raffia for work, take care to shake it well. You will find
that the best and easiest way to make it take the dye will be to soak it
over night. If this is not practicable then soak it
at<!--211.png--><span class="pagenum">164</span>
least three hours.
Dissolve the dye in vinegar&mdash;the dye bath should be warm.</p>

<p>The “Basic Colors” will give satisfaction, but I would suggest in cases
where a great deal of work is to be done that the fast acid colors be
used.</p>

<p>The color work in basketry plays a very important part as well as a
fascinating one. There are numerous ways in which a basket or tray may be
touched up, giving a charm to it that is most pleasing to the eye and
attractive to the craftsman.</p>

<p>The entire basket may be made first, and then either dipped, allowed to
stand in the dye a few minutes, or boiled five to thirty minutes; it may
be painted with Easy dye, stained with any desirable furniture stain,
varnished and waxed up. The basket may be finished off by using either
fine sandpaper, or powdered pumice stone, but in finishing colored
baskets, it will be found that singeing will be the most successful
method.</p>

<p>Again to have a contrasting color with the natural or two tints of the
same color, the reed should be dyed first and then the desired effect
worked out.</p>

<p>In dyeing reed allow it to soak in a mordant for two hours. This opens the
pores and makes the dye a permanent part of the basket. Three
ounces<!--212.png--><span class="pagenum">165</span>
of
alum to one quart of water makes a good mordant for many vegetable dyes.</p>

<p>Beautiful shades of brown, green, blue and red may be obtained by using
logwood, indigo, fustic, cutch, madder, cochineal, and copperas. A very
pleasing finish is secured by painting or staining the article with Light
Oil Finish, combining it with turpentine in whatever proportion desired.
Malachite green stain used with turpentine and Light Oil Finish make a
very attractive pale green. The alert basket maker, who desires to
experiment, must be on the watch in the autumn for natural dyeing
material. The leaves and flowers of plants, the bark of trees, berries,
etc., may be used most successfully in obtaining very desirable dye, and
with patience and care beautiful and delicate shades may be obtained from
vegetable dyes.</p>

<p>The following recipes may be used for vegetable dyeing:</p>

<p><b>Brown</b></p>

<p>Dissolve two teaspoonfuls of madder in one quart of water. Allow the reed
to soak in it five hours.</p>

<p><b>Yellow Brown No. 1</b></p>

<p>Soak the reed for several hours in
logwood<!--213.png--><span class="pagenum">166</span>
extract&mdash;obtained by boiling
logwood chips in water twenty minutes.</p>

<p><b>Yellow Brown No. 2</b></p>

<p>Mix in a quart of water two tablespoonfuls of cutch extract, adding one
and a half tablespoonfuls of fustic. Boil the reed in this solution for
two hours, but test.</p>

<p><b>Olive Brown No. 1</b></p>

<p>Dissolve two tablespoonfuls of cutch, two tablespoonfuls of fustic, and
one-half spoonful of logwood in a quart of water. Boil the reed two hours
in this composition.</p>

<p><b>Olive Brown No. 2</b></p>

<p>Boil the material several hours in a composition of one and one-half
pounds of walnut bark, five teaspoonfuls of washing soda and one-half cup
of rock alum.</p>

<p><b>Yellow No. 1</b></p>

<p>A good yellow can be obtained by experimenting with smartweed.</p>

<p><b>Yellow No. 2</b></p>

<p>Mordant the reed in a solution of alum, and boil it in an extract of
fustic, a half hour.</p><!--214.png--><p><span class="pagenum">167</span></p>

<p><b>Green</b></p>

<p>Mordant the reed in a solution of alum and water, and then dye it in the
solution composition&mdash;three teaspoonfuls of indigo, a small crystal of
copperas, and three pints of water. After the material is removed and
washed dip it in a solution of bark extract and water.</p>

<p><b>Olive Green</b></p>

<p>Mordant the reed in a solution of two teaspoonfuls of copperas in one
quart of water. Boil the reed then in the following solution: To three
teaspoonfuls of bark extract in a quart of water, add a half teaspoonful
of indigo and a small quantity of logwood.</p>

<p><b>Indian Red</b></p>

<p>Dissolve in about a quart of boiling water two tablespoonfuls of cutch
extract and a small crystal of blue-stone. Boil the material in this
solution until the desired color is obtained.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
